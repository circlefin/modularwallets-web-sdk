# Examples

We will keep adding examples to this directory to demonstrate how our SDK can be used in different use cases.

Please check out each example's README file to get started!

## Important: Using Workspaces

This project uses pnpm workspaces. Before running any example project, you need to build the SDK packages from the project root:

```bash
# From the project root directory
pnpm build
```

This will generate the necessary distribution files that the example projects depend on.
